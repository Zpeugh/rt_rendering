################################# LAB 5 README #################################

To run this lab you MUST use Firefox and not Chrome, as cross-origin scripting
is required to grab all of the resources necessary for the textures, and since I
did not write a server, Chrome will not work. Open index.html in Firefox and
then use the following keys to move the camera around the scene.

    a: Move Camera towards negative X
    d: Move Camera towards positive X
    s: Move Camera towards negative Y
    w: Move Camera towards positive Y
    z: Move Camera towards negative Z
    x: Move Camera towards positive Z

    <up arrow>:     Pan camera COI up
    <down arrow>:   Pan camera COI down
    <left arrow>:   Pan camera COI left
    <right arrow>:  Pan camera COI right

I made my little robot from the past labs have a rusty texture with a smooth
reflective movement ball and little reflective arms to hold onto his new jetpack.
I put the little guy in an industrial environment cube. and used both texture
mapping and environment mapping.


**The file webgl-obj-loader.js was not written by me, but I did modify it to get
the Javascript object in the proper format to work with my code.
