In order to use this program that creates bar charts based
on a comma seperated value (csv) file, you simply need to
click the "choose file" button, and then select a scv file
which has the following format:

    species, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
    setosa, 5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2
    virginica, 4.9, 3, 1.4, 0.2
    versicolor, 4.4, 4, 2.5, 1.2
    ...
    setosa, 5.2, 3.4, 1.3, 0.2

where there must be a single header row followed by any number
of data entry rows for keys "setosa", "virginica", or "versicolor".

Once the data has been properly imported, users may click the colors
coded buttons to see data for individual species, or all species at once.

**For any color blind users, the order of the bars is the same as the
order of the buttons.

The bonus task I attempted was beautifying the look and feel of the
overall page.

The browser this was developed in was Google Chrome.
